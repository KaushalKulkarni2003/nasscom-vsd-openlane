**IO Pads**: The interface terminals on a chip used for input and output signals to connect with external circuits.
**Die**: The small block of semiconducting material on which a given functional circuit is fabricated.
**Core**: The central part of the chip that contains the primary functional logic and processing units.
**IP (Intellectual Property)**: Pre-designed and pre-verified blocks or components used in chip design to accelerate development and ensure reliability.
**Macros**: Larger pre-designed and reusable functional units or blocks within a chip, such as memories or standard cells.
